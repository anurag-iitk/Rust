# Data Types in Rust

## What are data-types?
The data type of a value (or variable in some contexts) in an attribute that tells what kind of data that value can have.
In simple words it is value of a varibale

### Data types in Rust are divided into different groups:
* **Scalar Type**
* **Compound Type**

## Scalar Type
A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar type.
* **Integer**
* **Floating-point**
* **Boolean**
* **Character**

### Integer
An integer is a number without a fractional component. Integer can be further classified as Signed and Unsigned. Signed integers can store both negative and positive values. Unsigned integer can only store positive values. **Integer is i32 by default**
```
size        Signed  Unsigned
8 bit        i8      u8
16 bit      i16      u16
32 bit      i32      u32
64 bit      i64      u64
128 bit     i128     u128
Arch        Isize    usize
```
Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2^n-1) to 2^n-1 inclusive, where n is the number of bits that variant uses. So an i8 can store numbers from -(2^7) to 2^7-1, which equal to -128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2n-1, so a u8 can store numbers from 0 to 2^8, which equal 0 to 155.
Additionally, the isize and usize types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running.

### Floating-point Types
Rust also has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, which are numbers with decimal points. Rust's floating-point types are f32 and f64, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, resp. The **default type is f64** because on modern CPUs it's roughly the same speed as f32 but is capable of more precision. All floating point types are signed.
The f32 type is a single-precision float, and f64 has double precision.

### Boolean
Boolean types have two possible value- true or false. Use the bool keyword to declare a boolean variable.

### Character
The character data type in Rust supports numbers, alphabets, Unicode and special character. Use the char keyword to declare a variable of character data type.

**Note** that we specify char literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes. Rust's char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japenese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust.

### Automatic Type casting
Automatic type casting is not allowed in Rust.

### Number Separator
For easy readabilit of large numbers, we can use a visual separator_underscore to separate digits. That is **50000 can be written as 50_000**.

## Example
```
fn main(){
    let _name:char = 'a';
    let emoji_char = 'üòÅ'
    let _num:i8 = 10_000; // means value is 10,000
    let _float:i8 = 1.5;
    let _bool:bool = true;
}
```
