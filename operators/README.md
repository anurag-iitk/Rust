# Operators in Rust

## Operators
An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical operation and produce final result
```
Operant     Operator      Operand
1              +            2
```

### The following are the types of operators in Rust:
* **Arithmetic Operators**
* **Comparison Operators**
* **Logical Operators**
* **Bitwise Operators**
* **Compound Assignment Operators**

## Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used for performing mathematical operations like addition, substraction, multiplication, and division.
```
Operator    Explanation                                                                     Example
+           Returns the addition of two operands                                            A+B = 10
-           Returns the difference of the values (subtract right operand from left)         A-B = 23
*           Returns the product of the values                                               A*B = 100
/           Divide left operand by right one and returns the quotient                       A/B = 3
%           Divide left operand by right one and returns the remainder                      A%B = 9
```

## Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are the operators that compare value and return true or false depending upon the conditions.
```
Operator        Explanation                 Example
>               Greater than                (A+B) is true
<               Less than                   (A<B) is false
==              Equal to                    (A==B) is false
!=              Not equal to                (A!=B) is true
>=              Greater than and equal to   (A>=B) is true
<=              Less than and equal to      (A<=B) is false
```

## Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions. Logical operators too, return a Boolean value.
```
Operator    Explanation
&&          The operator returns true only if all the expressions specified return true 
||          The operator returns true if at least one of the expressions specified return true
!           The operator returns the inverse of the expressionâ€™s result
```

## Compound Assignment Operator
Compound assignment operators perform the operation specified by the additional operator, then assign the result to the left operant.
```
Operator    Explanation
+=          Arithmetic addition and assignment
-=          Arithmetic subtraction and assignment
*=          Arithmetic multiplication and assignment
/=          Arithmetic division and assignment
%=          Arithmetic remainder and assignment
```
