# Rust Programming

## What is Rust?
```Rust is a multi-paradism, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency.
Rust is a system level programming language, developed by Graydon Hoare. Mozilla Labs acquired the programme.```

## Why Rust?
```Rust focuses on three goals:
1. Speed
2. Safety
3. Concurrency

The language was designed for developing highly reliable and fast software in a simple way. Rust can be used to write high-level programs down to hardware-specific programs.```
